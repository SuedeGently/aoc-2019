<p>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. This is a repo of solutions for as many as I have time for written entirely in Rust as practice coding.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p><code>bash
aoc-2019 [OPTIONS] &lt;puzzle&gt;</code>
Where puzzle is a 3 digit indicator of which solution to run (i.e. <code>021</code> = puzzle 2 day 1).
The <code>-p</code> flag can be used to set a custom input file, otherwise the default one provided by aoc will be used.</p>
<h2 id="optimisation">Optimisation</h2>
<p>There is none. Do not look for it, you will be dissappointed.</p>
