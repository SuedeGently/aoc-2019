# aoc-2019
> Advent of Code 2019 Entry by SuedeGently

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. This is a repo of solutions for as many as I have time for written entirely in Rust as practice coding.

## Usage
```bash
aoc-2019 [OPTIONS] <puzzle>
```
Where puzzle is a 3 digit indicator of which solution to run (i.e. `021` = puzzle 2 day 1).
The `-p` flag can be used to set a custom input file where appropriate, otherwise the default one provided by aoc will be used. Where bounds are required, a lower bound can be set with --low and a higher bound with --high, otherwise the smallest and largest possible bounds will be used.

## Optimisation
There is none. Do not look for it, you will be dissappointed.
