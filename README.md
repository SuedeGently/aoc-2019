> Advent of Code 2019 Entry by SuedeGently
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

## Usage
```bash
aoc-2019 [OPTIONS] <puzzle>
```
Where puzzle is a 3 digit indicator of which solution to run (i.e. `021` = puzzle 2 day 1).

## Optimisation
There is none. Do not look for it, you will be dissappointed.
